# Personalized Recipe Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a personalized recipe recommendation system. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest recipes tailored to user preferences, including calorie ranges, macronutrient goals, dietary tags, and ingredient preferences.

## Features
- Personalized recipe recommendations based on user input.
- Flexible filtering for calories, macronutrients, cooking time, and dietary preferences.
- Integration of USDA FoodData Central and Food.com datasets.
- A streamlined and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- `pip` package manager

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coletted1/TeamShallotML4VA.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TeamShallotML4VA/my_app
   ```

## Running the Application
1. Navigate to the `my_app` directory:
   ```bash
   cd my_app
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app:

   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open the app in your browser. By default, Streamlit runs on `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage
1. **Input User Preferences**:
   - Set calorie, macronutrient, and cooking time ranges.
   - Choose dietary tags (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, desserts).
   - Specify ingredients to include or exclude.

2. **Get Recommendations**:
   - Click the "Get Recommendations" button to receive personalized recipe suggestions.

3. **View Results**:
